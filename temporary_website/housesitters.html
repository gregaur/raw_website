			<p>Housesitters came to us wanting to update their old template website with something fresh. The Housesitter branding contained a lot of light blue and white which looked very washed out and their logo needed some work too. Thankfully the client was open to change in this area and I was able to bring in a complimentary turquoise colour which would be the dominant colour for the whole of the Housesitter section and a point of difference to the blue Homeowner part of the site. Bringing in a further deep blue helped these colours stand out further. I was responsible for the design and development of the main menu navigation pages and form elements which would get carried through the rest of the site by the back-end developer.</p>
