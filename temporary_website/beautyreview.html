			<p>This project was a redesign of an existing website that had become outdated and it had a number of feature additions over time which meant much of the initial design integrity had been lost. We also introduced the Photo Wall section (see below). The key concern from the client was that users were arriving on the site not quite sure what to do next. Our solution was coming up with a more explanative menu structure which would give new users an introduction to different parts of the site and wouldn't get in the way for returning users. My role for this project spanned from design of the layout and individual elements to coding the designs into the staging site and adding subtle animations. Building the menu system and it's functionality from scratch was my favourite part.</p>
