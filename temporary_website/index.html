			<h2>Preferred Workflow</h2>
			
			<p>Where I currently work, every project requires a different approach, some projects require more design/branding focus, where others have established design and require more UX/UI strategy or front-end development consideration.
			
				<br /><br />In my ideal scenario my preference would be starting off with discussion with the client, project manager and back-end developer. If the design direction is already established, I'll then sit down with a pencil and paper and start nutting out the structure of elements and interaction processes keeping in mind any user-research that we may have at hand.<br />Once I have some direction but still a few ideas floating around my head, I'll then use  <a target="blank" href="http://www.sketchapp.com/">Sketch</a> for laying out the frames and <a target="blank" href="http://www.invisionapp.com/">InVisionapp</a> for prototyping. I've recently discovered these after years of using Adobes Creative Suite and find them more in tune with a rapid ux workflow that requires constant feedback. During this process I'll also start thinking about the design of individual elements and how they'll interact, I like to use <a href="https://medium.com/re-write/the-unicorn-workflow-design-to-code-with-atomic-design-principles-and-sketch-8b0fe7d05a37">Atomic Design</a> principles at this stage.<br />Once we have some feedback from the client and the initial structure has been approved, I'll continue to flesh out the wireframes to full designs. For this I may bring in Photoshop for finer image editing.
			<br /><br />
			Once all design and prototypes have been finalised and signed off, it's then time to start coding. I start off by laying out the element structure using Html and Css and defining all my general page styles, once again keeping the client in the loop and aware of how things are progressing. I've started using git for version control in case the client changes their mind on something or if something doesn't quite work out at this point.<br />I'll then add some jQuery for changing different element states or Javascript plugins to add some further functionality if required. I also use <a target="blank" href="https://medium.com/@preslavrachev/gulp-vs-grunt-why-one-why-the-other-f5d3b398edc4">Gulp</a> task runner for compiling Sass and for a few other areas that need a helping hand which has enabled me get through projects more efficiently. <br />At this point, I'll be working simultaneously with the back-end developer as he sets up the back-end functionality and integrating my front-end code into a master version. I find constant communication with the back-end developer is crucial to iron out any small issues before they begin to snowball. <br />
			Once we've finished with the development aspects and completed user testing, it'll then be time to go live!
